# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is a simple rock paper scissors game from the odin project.
This is my first javascript project. It has no GUI for now. Everything will be run in the console.
The GUI will be added later in the future.

The goal of this project is to help improve my problem solving skills and also my knowledge in javascript fundamentals.
